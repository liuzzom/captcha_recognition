A 4 characters captcha recognition project for the Data and Document Mining course.
Our work is based on "A Multi-Label Neural Network Approach to Solving Connected CAPTCHAs". You can find this article on https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322783030_A_Multi-Label_Neural_Network_Approach_to_Solving_Connected_CAPTCHAs.
Here you can find some codes we wrote for the dataset creation and for the ANN creation, test and evaluation
